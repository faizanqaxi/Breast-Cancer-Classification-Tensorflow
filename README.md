# Breast-Cancer-Classification-Tensorflowjs
Made breast cancer classifier in tensorflow.js. Used wdbc dataset to train the model. Made a neural network with 5 dense layers followed by an output layer at the end. Used RMSprop as the optimizer and binary cross entropy as the loss function as we have 2 possible outputs.
